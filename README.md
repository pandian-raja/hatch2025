# Breast Cancer Detection in Microscope Images

**Inspiration** 
We developed this project to reduce human error in breast cancer detection by creating an AI-powered companion app for microscopy image analysis.

**What It Does:**
One in eight women in the US will develop breast cancer, making early detection crucial. We've developed an LLM-based model to identify benign and malignant breast tumors in microscope images.

**Development Process Data:** 
Trained on the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis) Model: Utilized ChatGPT 4o for image analysis UI: Built using Google IDX for accessible implementation

**Future Development**
- Expand our dataset for increased accuracy
- Complete the model integration to reduce AI hallucinations
- Implement the solution in clinical settings
